# odin-recipes
Build a basic recipe website.
In this project i will use proabably everyrthing ive learned so far on git.
How to use the boilerplate for a plate.
Add text, links, and images and multiple pages to the site

Reflection:
I had trouble rembering how to write the README file.
Inserting the hyeprlinks was easy and fun.
I found it a bit tediopus to write lists. I suspect theres an easier or more efficient way.
Same thing goes for spacing text to make it better to read the dish descriptions.
I was too lazy and just copied the chicken alferedo page and changed the picture.
I believe i achieved the lesson obejctives regardless.
